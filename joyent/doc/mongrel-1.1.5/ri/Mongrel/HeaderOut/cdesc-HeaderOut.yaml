  body: This class implements a simple way of constructing the HTTP headers dynamically via a Hash syntax. Think of it as a write-only Hash. Refer to HttpResponse for information on how this is used.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: One consequence of this write-only nature is that you can write multiple headers by just doing them twice (which is sometimes needed in HTTP), but that the normal semantics for Hash (where doing an insert replaces) is not there.
